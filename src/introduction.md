# Introduction
Welcome to the Expressway docs! 
This site will house examples and documentation 
of various features found within Expressway and Roadrunner itself!

Installation instructs can be found [here](installation.md).

## Kotlin?

Expressway is written in Kotlin, a modern language that is fully interoperable with Java.
This means that you can use both Java and Kotlin code in the same project.
For the most part, the code examples in this documentation will be in Kotlin,
but Java versions of the same code will be provided when necessary.

More information about Kotlin can be found [here](https://kotlinlang.org/), 
and [this Cookbook article](https://cookbook.dairy.foundation/misc/why_kotlin/why_kotlin.html) 
explains some of its benefits and usage in FTC.
